# Ex-Weather

A (very) simple weather station application coded in Phoenix LiveView.

## Getting Started

First, review `config/dev.secret.exs.EXAMPLE`; follow the customization and renaming instructions 
specified by it.

Once config is finished, you'll need Phoenix installed (and Elixir and Erlang as well.) The official Phoenix installation guide can be found [`here`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content); this guide will also walk you through adding Erlang and Elixir to your development machine, if you don't already have them.   Note that `ex-weather` doesn't use a database for anything, so no Postgres required.

Once your development environment is set up, starting your Phoenix server is simple:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Once you've started Phoenix you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
